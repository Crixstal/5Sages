## **Description**

The project objective is to write a multithreaded program that will solve the riddle of the 5 wise men's dinner.

![Table](table.png "Sages layout")

## **Informations**

The program runs in Debug or Release, platform x64.  
In the zip file "GP2_MEHALIN_M" on sirius you can find :
- the README file
- "table.png" to see the sages layout
- the bin folder which contains "5Sages.exe" (Release) to launch the program

## **Work in progress**

- programmable variables without recompiling the code
- better display in the console
- specific text color and white background per sage name (see `void printName()`)

## **Known issues**

The program only works with 5 sages.
